            <p>Continuing the exploration of surreal and liminal spaces, this piece aims to encapsulate a distinct atmospheric essence. Drawing considerable inspiration from Stanley Donwood's evocative artworks for the cover of Radiohead's Kid A, my objective was to craft an aesthetic reminiscent of a bygone era within the digital expanse of landscapes. To accomplish this, I utilized an image of a random mountain range sourced from Google Earth Pro, superimposing it with my landscapes that were intentionally stretched to the point of unrecognizability.
The figure depicted is  myself, trapped within the confines of a polygonal face, accentuating the concept of outdated character models. Using the diffuse glow filter, I enhanced the mountain figures and ground, creating an ethereal overlay that adds a surreal touch. The overarching goal was to evoke a sense of vast emptiness, a detachment from reality that verges on the sublime. To infuse the landscape with an otherworldly quality, the spikes were used, functioning as a visual element  amplifying the surreal ambiance. In essence, the composition strives to transport the viewer into a space where the boundaries between the real and the unreal blur, leaving behind an indelible impression of an ethereal, dreamlike realm.
