            <p>The idea of a paradox was paradoxical to me for a while. This piece led me in many directions and left me aimlessly searching for ideas. These pieces encapsulate the process that led to this artwork and the pieces that encompass the journey. Each piece on the walls surrounding the figure represented ideas that I felt didn't entirely satisfy the concept of a paradox. I knew I wanted to create something related to the human form, emphasizing either its exaggeration or disintegration. This inspiration comes from Francis Bacon and his style, with the main figure bearing a resemblance to Bacon's deformation of the human body. For this figure, I took multiple shots of myself in a chair and then merged them using a lighter colour filter. This approach allowed each position to remain completely visible without affecting one another. I was also interested in David Lynch's ability to create a surreal liminal space. Therefore, I made the colour of the wall in this piece to the likeliness of the Red Room in Twin Peaks. I appreciate this piece; it's weird and somewhat unsettling.</p>
