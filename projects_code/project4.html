            <p>Going home for the weekend after school is a bit funny. You get this overwhelming sense of familiarity like you never really left. Trying to put that feeling into words is tough, but I gave it a shot with these pieces – a space that's real but also kind of surreal.

I wanted some texture in my work. Photoshop brushes tend to be too smooth for me, and I don't feel like spending $30 on a pack of digital paintbrushes. So I went all in on the texture filters. I used a bunch of textures like the texturizer, oil paint, mosaic, and glass filter. The Gaussian blur was my go-to for the second piece, making everything blend. 

Lately, I've been into hard edges. I'd outline stuff in the room with the lasso tool and then fill it in with the brush. 

I also made sure to include some type of framing for both pieces. The first piece has the space existing within the framing yet bleeding out at the bottom. A Polaroid was my inspiration for the second piece, a surreal space captured in a polaroid.

I've been reading up on Matisse lately. You might not see his style in my pieces, but I'm trying to channel his approach to art – something that represents how I feel, focusing more on expression than anything else.
