            <p>I undertook this project without any specific goals in mind, driven solely by a desire to convey my personal expression. I aimed to create something deeply personal and intentionally complex, both for interpretation and my own understanding. I allowed the creative process to flow naturally, observing where it would take me.

Despite this, I can provide a technical overview of the project. It began by layering and blending various images to create an abstract composition. I used images from different sources, including a summer painting, a scene of pollen on water, a waterfront with a boat, a chalk wall, and pumpkins. These layers were subjected to the mosaic filter, with varying levels of pixelation applied. A layer of grain was added to all elements for texture.

Continuing the process, I applied different colour overlays to each image and merged the layers to create the background. I also manipulated an image of myself using content-aware scaling to alter proportions and dimensions. I traced my facial features on paper and incorporated this as an overlay on my face.

Finally, I added the text "huh." at the top and introduced red and yellow pixelation on the far left using an image of apple bins. My main source of inspiration for this project was an art piece featured in Atlanta's S1: E9 at the 7:26 mark. I also drew some influence from the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat.
